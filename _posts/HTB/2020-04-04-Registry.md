# Hackthebox - Registry - 10.10.10.159

## Summary

Today [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Registry, a hard-rated Linux box running Docker and [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/), a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images using HTTP API, and using [restic backup](https://restic.net/) to perform backup and restore operations.
Here's my write-up.

![InfoCard](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/InfoCard.jpg)

## Enumeration

Starting enumeration off with an initial nmap scan.
```
nmap -sV -sT -sC -p- -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.159
```
The initial nmap scan shows 3 opened ports 22 – ssh, 80 and 443 – webserver, and port 976 which seems have IP-based filtering configured.

![nmapinitial](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/nmapinitial.jpg)

It also shows a cname used in the ssl cert as docker.registry.htb, so I’ll be adding it in my /etc/hosts file.


While gobuster is running and doing a light-weight directory scan on the webserver running on port 80, I start manually digging through the webpages.
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.159 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x .html,.php,.txt -t 200
```

The landing page on the website served on port 80 is just the default nginx page.

![webpage](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/webpage.jpg)

But I'm more interested on what's on https://docker.registry.htb

![dockerpage](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/dockerpage.jpg)

Searching the internet for docker vulnerabilities, I found [this article](https://www.notsosecure.com/anatomy-of-a-hack-docker-registry/) with a very familiar name.
Based on the Docker Registry API URL, I start navigating through the docker.registry.htb page, after a prompt asking me for a user and pass where the good old admin:admin combo worked, I stumbled upon their repository.

![dockercatalog](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/dockercatalog.jpg) 

Now, to list the contents.

![catalogcontents](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/catalogcontents.jpg) 

Accessing https://docker.registry.htb/v2/bolt-image/manifests/latest, I get a prompt to download a file named latest which contains the names of all the blobs in this repository as well as the commands used to setup this docker instance. 

![blob](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blob.jpg) 

I downloaded the blob files using the following command
```
while read x; do
wget --no-check-certificate "https://admin:admin@docker.registry.htb/v2/bolt-image/blobs/${x}"
done << DLD
``` 
![blobdld](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blobdld.jpg)

In the meantime, gobuster was able to find some more directories for the main site.

![gobuster](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/gobuster.jpg)

## Initial foothold and user flag

In the dokerdump directory, the location I used to download the blob files during the previous step, I can see that the files are archives that can be opened and navigated.

![blobfiles](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blobfiles.jpg)

In one of the files I found the ssh rsa key.

![blobssh](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blobssh.jpg)

The ssh config file.

![blobsshconfig](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blobsshconfig.jpg)

And also the file containing the password for the ssh key - __GkOcz221Ftb3ugog__

![blobsshpass](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/blobsshpass.jpg)

Time to attempt to ssh into the server with the credentials obtained from the blob files.

![sshconn](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/sshconn.jpg)

I'm able to get the user flag.

![userflag](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/userflag.jpg)

## Further enumeration and escalation to www-data

Doing more enumeration with the bolt user I’ve found backup.php, which contains some useful information - the server uses [restic backup](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/010_introduction.html) to perform backup and restore operations.

![backupphp](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/backupphp.jpg)

The webserver also hosts a CMS called [bolt](https://bolt.cm/)

![boltdir](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltdir.jpg)

In the /var/www/html/bolt/app/database directory I find the bolt.db sqlite database which I then scp to my machine so that I can freely poke at it.

![boltdb](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltdb.jpg)

![boltscp](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltscp.jpg)

Using SQLITE browser I was able to find the password hash of the admin account used for the Bolt CMS.

![boltpasshash](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltpasshash.jpg)

I pasted the password into boltadm_hash.txt and then used john with its default wordlist.

![boltjohn](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltjohn.jpg)

It looks like the password for the CMS admin is __strawberry__ 
Trying to access Bolt’s admin interface, I just end up on a placeholder page.

![samplesite](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/samplesite.jpg)

So I use wfuzz to get the rest of the URL
```
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hc 403,404,400 -u http://10.10.10.159/bolt/FUZZ -t 100 -Z
```
Which finds another bolt directory inside the initial one.

![boltwebdir](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltwebdir.jpg)

Accessing 10.10.10.159/bolt/bolt takes me to the login page.

![boltlogin](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltlogin.jpg)

In the configuration>main configuration section, I scroll to "accepted file types", add php to the list, and save the changes.

![boltfiletypes](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltfiletypes.jpg)

I then use the "File Management" section to upload [WhiteWinterWolf’s webshell](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell).

![boltshellup](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltshellup.jpg)

I access webshell.php and start an nc.traditional listener (this was the only one that worked).

![boltshellup](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltshellup.jpg)

Then I connected to the lsitener from my machine.

![boltshellnetcat](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/boltshellnetcat.jpg)

I am now connected to the server as the www-data user.
First thing I do is check if the www-data user has any sudo permissions.

![sudo-l](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/sudo-l.jpg)

Looks like the www-data user can do restic backups as sudo.
After a few minutes, I decide to try and upload a [python bindshell](https://github.com/s7ephen/Tamatebako/blob/master/bindshell.py) via scp and then call it via the php webshell, after noticing that my current shell conenction is failry limited and dies out quickly.

![pythonshellup](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/pythonshellup.jpg)

I connect to the bindhsell from my machine and got an actual shell this time.

![pythonshell](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/pythonshell.jpg)

## Privilege escalation and root flag

I proceed to install restic on my machine.

![resticinstall](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/resticinstall.jpg)

Followed by the [rest-server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server), so that I will be able to transfer backups to it.
Starting the server.

![startrestserver](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/startrestserver.jpg)

Since outbound connections are blocked, I’ll need to forward the port.

![portfwd](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/portfwd.jpg)

I initiate the repository on my server from the victim's side with a simple password.

![initrest](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/initrest.jpg)

And I take a backup of the root flag.

![rootflagbkp](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/rootflagbkp.jpg)

I then restore the snapshot.

![snapshotrestore](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/snapshotrestore.jpg)

And read the root flag.

![rootflag](/assets/images/HTB/Registry/rootflag.jpg)

The same process can be used to get root's ssh key as well as the /etc/shadow file.
