# Hackthebox - Mango - 10.10.10.162

## Summary
Today, [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Mango, a medium-rated Linux box hosting two websites and a MongoDB instance.

>*Note that the screenshots are taken today (2020-04-18) because I didn't do a proper write-up during my first run on the box.*

## Enumeration

Starting enumeration off with an initial nmap scan.
```
nmap -sV -sT -sC -p- -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.162
```

From nmap's results, it looks like the server is hosting two websites, one on port 80 and one on port 443.

The SSL certificate for the site on port 443 has staging-order.mango.htb as the common name for the site, so I'll add that to my /etc/hosts file as well.

The website on port 80 just throws a 403 error.

While the website on port 443 leads to a login page.

After gobuster and dirbuster scans that yielded nothing useful, aside from the staging-order.mango.htb/index.php and a few other generic pages,
I've decided to check the HTB blog for some hints, a few forum members were pointing out the similarities between the name of the box and the name of a NoSQL DBMS - MongoDB.

## Initial foothold

After a bit of googling for NoSQL injection attacks, I find [this script](https://github.com/an0nlk/Nosql-MongoDB-injection-username-password-enumeration/blob/master/nosqli-user-pass-enum.py) that looks like it could help in this situation.

First I need to enumerate all the users:
```
python ~/Scripts/nosqli-user-pass-enum.py -u http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php -up username -pp password -op login:login -ep username -m POST
```
And the script is able to find 2 usernames.

![users](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/users.jpg)

Then I need to get each user's password.

```
python ~/Scripts/nosqli-user-pass-enum.py -u http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php -up username -pp password -op login:login -ep password -m POST
```

The script found passwords for both users.

![passwords](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/passwords.jpg)

And, after logging on the website with the newly found credentials I can validate that the follwoing username and password combinations work
__admin t9KcS3>!0B#2__
__mango h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H__

After logging into the website, it looks like it's still under construction.

So I decide to try the credentials to ssh into the server.

Admin doesn't have permission to ssh.

But mango does.

## User flag

Once connected to the server as mango, I start using the [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/) in hopes of finding more info inside the database itself, but I am unable to find any other useful information besides what I already have.

I attempt to switch user to admin and it works, so I get the user flag.

## Privilege escalation and root flag

MongoDB uses Java, which means that [jjs](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/) might be available on the machine.
jjs runs with the SUID bit set and can be exploited to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID backdoor,
And it turns out that jjs is indeed available on the amchine. 

![jjs](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/jjs.jpg)

Time to see if I can use it to read the root.txt file from inside jjs.

![rootflag](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/rootflag.jpg)

jjs creates a .jjs.history file that logs all the commands

![jjshistory](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/jjshistory.jpg)

So I'll just delete that file after exiting jjs.

![rmjjshistory](/assets/images/HTB/Mango/rmjjshistory.jpg)

And that's it.
