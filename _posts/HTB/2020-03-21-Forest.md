# Hackthebox - Forest - 10.10.10.161
## Summary
Today [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Forest, an easy-rated Windows box that acts as the domain controller for the htb.local domain. This was a great learning experience since Forest was my first Windows Domain Controller, and I got a chance to learn how to use Impacket's AD-oriented scripts, as well as getting familiar with BloodHound and SharpHound.
Here's my write-up.
>*Note that the screenshots are taken today (2020-03-21) because I didn't do a proper write-up during my first run on Postman.*

## Enumeration

For an initial scan I used the following nmap command 
```
nmap -A -sV -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.161
```
![nmapinitial01](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/nmapinitial01.jpg)
![nmapinitial02](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/nmapinitial02.jpg)

The nmap scan reveals that the machine is a domain controller for the htb.local domain judging by the 2 LDAP services ports (389 and 3268).
Even if the smb port is opened, attempting to list shares using smbclient does not list anything without proper authentication. 

While nmap was running, I also kicked off enum4linux to get a better idea of users, groups, service accounts, and accessible network shares.
```
enum4linux -o -U -G -S -P 10.10.10.161 > enum4linux.txt
```
Once finished, enum4linux returns some useful information about the target.
For starters, it looks like there's no propper password complexity policy put in place, meaning that, if I'm able to obtain a hash, it should be failry easy to crack since nothing is forcing users to set complex passwords.

The local user accounts where retunred, including a service account - svc-alfresco

![enum4linux_users](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/enum4linux_users.jpg)

This also shows the fact that the target is running Microsoft Exchange Server, which might be a path for privilege escalation.

## Initial Foothold and User Flag

After reading a bit through the [Forest HTB Forum](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/2319/forest#latest) thread, I saw a few hints pointing towards Impacket's GetNPUsers.py script (more examples on kerberos attacks can be found [here](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/)).
I've tried running the script against all the users i've found using enum4linux, and the only one that did not require Kerberos pre-authentication was svc-alfresco os I was able to get its TGT with the following command 
```
python ~/Scripts/Impacket/impacket-0.9.20/examples/GetNPUsers.py htb.local/svc-alfresco -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -format john
```
![TGThash](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/TGThash.jpg)

Which I then proceede to crack using john.
![john](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/john.jpg)

It looks like the password for svc-alfresco is __s3rvice__ and I am able to use it with evil-winrm 
```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u svc-alfresco -p 's3rvice' -s './ps1_scripts/' -e './exe_files/'
```
and get the user flag.

## Privilege escalation

Someone on the forum mentioned that [BloodHound's](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) SharpHound.exe ingestor (I couldn't get SharpHound.ps1 to run through evil-winrm) can be used to get a better idea of what the shortest route to DA would be.
So i booted my Windows VM, started CMD as svc-alfresco and executed SharpHound.exe.
![SharpHound_exe](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/SharpHound_exe.jpg)

I then move the resulting .zip file to my Kali VM, fire up neo4j console and bloodhound, and import the zip file into BloodHound for querying.
The "Find Shortest Paths to Domain Admins" query shows that I can use the fact that svc-alfresco is a member of the Account Operators group to add either the service account itself or a newly created account to the Exchange Windows Permissions group, whose WriteDacl access on the Domain object in Active Directory can be used to escalate to DA, as outlined [here](https://www.andreafortuna.org/2019/01/30/abusing-microsoft-exchange-for-privilege-escalation-any-user-may-obtain-domain-admin-privileges/).

![BloodHound](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/BloodHound.jpg)

I picked the route of creating a separate user account that I can add to the Exchange Windows Permissions group.
I connect with evil-winrm as svc-alfresco to create the following user account and add it to all the required groups:
```
New-ADUser -Name "TestUser" -Type User -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "p@ssw0rd" -Force) -Enabled $True
Add-AdGroupMember -Identity  "Remote Desktop Users" -Members TestUser
Add-AdGroupMember -Identity  "Remote Management Users" -Members TestUser
Add-AdGroupMember -Identity  "Exchange Windows Permissions" -Members TestUser
```
After that, I can use Impacket's ntlmrelayx.py to escalate TestUser's privileges
```python ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://10.10.10.161 --escalate-user TestUser```
![TestUser_privesc](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/TestUser_privesc.jpg)

Now I can use Impacket's secretsdump.py with TestUser's credentials to dump all the password hasses contained in the NTDS.DIT file on 10.10.10.161.
![hashes](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/hashes.jpg)

With the Admin hash obtained through secretsdump.py, I can use wmiexec.py to connect as Administrator 
```
python wmiexec.py -hashes aad..4ee:326..ea6 Administrator@10.10.10.161
```

![adminroot](/assets/images/HTB/Forest/adminroot.jpg)

And remove the TestUser account.
