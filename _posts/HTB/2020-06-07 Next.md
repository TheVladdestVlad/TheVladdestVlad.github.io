# Hackthebox - Nest - 10.10.10.178

## Summary
Today, [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Nest, an easy-rated Windows machine with multiple file shares and a service used for LDAP reporting.
Here's my write-up.

![InfoCard](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/InfoCard.png)

## Enumeration

Starting enumeration off with an initial nmap scan.
```
nmap -sV -sT -sC -p- -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.178
```

Based on the nmap results, it looks like there is an HQK Reporting Service running on port 4386, but I can't seem to access it now.

But it looks like SMB should be accessible, so that seems like the initial ingress point.

![nmapsmb](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/nmapsmb.png)


Using smbclient reveals the following shared directories.

![smbshares](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/smbshares.png)

## Initial foothold

Using Guest authentication, I'm only limited to a few shared directories and subdirectories that I can access, but an email template I've found in the \\10.10.10.178\Data\Templates\HR\ directory has the required information for the to gain an initial foothold and possible access to more shared directories.

## Enumerating as TempUser

Using the previously obtained credentials, I can now access more shared directories that might contain something to help with escalating to another user.

Username: TempUser
Password: welcome2019

Accessing smb as TempUser works,

In \\10.10.10.178\Data\IT\Configs\RU Scanner\
I find the RU_config.xml file that has a user name and an encrypted password.

![RUConfig](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/RUConfig.png)

One other interesting file in this share is the config.xml file located in \\10.10.10.178\Data\IT\Configs\NotepadPlusPlus\ which contains the following lines.

```
    <History nbMaxFile="15" inSubMenu="no" customLength="-1">
        <File filename="C:\windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" />
        <File filename="\\HTB-NEST\Secure$\IT\Carl\Temp.txt" />
        <File filename="C:\Users\C.Smith\Desktop\todo.txt" />
    </History>

```
This is interesting, because the contents of \\10.10.10.178\Secure$ aren't accessible for TempUser, but TempUser has access when to \\10.10.10.178\Secure$\IT\Carl\

![Carl](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/Carl.png)

I proceed to copy all of the contents of Carl's directory since the VB Project he is working one seems to be related to the RU_config.xml file found previously.

![CopyCarl](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/CopyCarl.png)


I copy the VB Projects directory to my Windows machine and open the RUScanner.sln file in Visual Studio to see what it does and how it interacts with the RU_config.xml file.

Looking at the solution's Module1.vb file, it looks like all that's needed is to add a few lines to make the exe print the password when executed.

![RUScannerModule1orig](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/RUScannerModule1orig.png)

![RUScannerModule1](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/RUScannerModule1.png)

I build the solution and copy the RU_config.xml file in the RUScanner\bin\debug\ directory where the exe file has been built just now.

![RUScanner](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/RUScanner.png)

And I proceed to run the executable in cmd.

![RUScanPass](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/RUScanner.png)


## Privilege escalation to C.Smith and user flag

After a few tries, it looks like the password provided by the modified RUScanner belongs to the C.Smith user, and I am able to connect as C.Smith via smbclient which also gets me the user flag from \\10.10.10.178\Users\C.Smith\

![csmithsmb](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/csmithsmb.png)

Listing the HQK Reporting directory shows something that caught my attention, a 0 Bytes file named Debug Mode Password.txt.

![HQKReportingDir](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/HQKReportingDir.png)

Reading the file with more reveals nothing, after some hints on the forum, I was lead to [Alternate Data Streams](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/)

Checking the file with the allinfo command, reveals that the file actually has an ADS named Password linked to it.

![moreinfo](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/moreinfo.png)

Using ```more "Debug Mode Password.txt:Password"``` I can read the contents of the ADS, and the password is _WBQ201953D8w_

![ADSContent](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/ADSContent.png)

In the same directory there is also a HQK_Config_Backup.xml file, which is related to the service listening on port 4386.

![HQKConfigBackup](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/HQKConfigBackup.png)

And the \\10.10.10.178\Users\C.Smith\HQK Reporting\AD Integration Module\ directory contains an exe file named HqkLdap.exe, which, judging by its name, seems to also be related to the service listening on port 4386.

I copy the contents of the \\10.10.10.178\Users\C.Smith\HQK Reporting\ directory to my VM.

![CopyHQKR](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/CopyHQKR.png)

And then move the HqkLdap.exe to my Windows machine to try and find out what it does.

At first I simply try to run HqkLdap.exe like any normal exe file, but it only flashes a cmd window briefly and does nothing else.
My next attempt is to run it from Command Prompt in hopes of seeing if it returns any error messages.

![hqkldapexe_run1](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/hqkldapexe_run1.png)

It looks like it takes at least one command line argument to execute it, so I decide to copy the HQK_Config_Backup.xml file in the same directory as the exe and pass it as an argument.

![hqkldapexe_run2](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/hqkldapexe_run2.png)

After that last error message, I decide to use [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) to decompile the exe and look at the code.

Looking at the code in CR.cs, it's obvious that this is another inhouse built password encryption/decryption process.

```
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

namespace HqkLdap
{
  public class CR
  {
    private const string K = "667912";
    private const string I = "1L1SA61493DRV53Z";
    private const string SA = "1313Rf99";

    public static string DS(string EncryptedString)
    {
      return string.IsNullOrEmpty(EncryptedString) ? string.Empty : CR.RD(EncryptedString, "667912", "1313Rf99", 3, "1L1SA61493DRV53Z", 256);
    }

    public static string ES(string PlainString)
    {
      return string.IsNullOrEmpty(PlainString) ? string.Empty : CR.RE(PlainString, "667912", "1313Rf99", 3, "1L1SA61493DRV53Z", 256);
    }

    private static string RE(
      string plainText,
      string passPhrase,
      string saltValue,
      int passwordIterations,
      string initVector,
      int keySize)
    {
      byte[] bytes1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(initVector);
      byte[] bytes2 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(saltValue);
      byte[] bytes3 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(plainText);
      byte[] bytes4 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passPhrase, bytes2, passwordIterations).GetBytes(checked ((int) Math.Round(unchecked ((double) keySize / 8.0))));
      AesCryptoServiceProvider cryptoServiceProvider = new AesCryptoServiceProvider();
      cryptoServiceProvider.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
      ICryptoTransform encryptor = cryptoServiceProvider.CreateEncryptor(bytes4, bytes1);
      using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
      {
        using (CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream((Stream) memoryStream, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
        {
          cryptoStream.Write(bytes3, 0, bytes3.Length);
          cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
          byte[] array = memoryStream.ToArray();
          memoryStream.Close();
          cryptoStream.Close();
          return Convert.ToBase64String(array);
        }
      }
    }

    private static string RD(
      string cipherText,
      string passPhrase,
      string saltValue,
      int passwordIterations,
      string initVector,
      int keySize)
    {
      byte[] bytes1 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(initVector);
      byte[] bytes2 = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(saltValue);
      byte[] buffer = Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText);
      byte[] bytes3 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passPhrase, bytes2, passwordIterations).GetBytes(checked ((int) Math.Round(unchecked ((double) keySize / 8.0))));
      AesCryptoServiceProvider cryptoServiceProvider = new AesCryptoServiceProvider();
      cryptoServiceProvider.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
      ICryptoTransform decryptor = cryptoServiceProvider.CreateDecryptor(bytes3, bytes1);
      MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream(buffer);
      CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream((Stream) memoryStream, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read);
      byte[] numArray = new byte[checked (buffer.Length + 1)];
      int count = cryptoStream.Read(numArray, 0, numArray.Length);
      memoryStream.Close();
      cryptoStream.Close();
      return Encoding.ASCII.GetString(numArray, 0, count);
    }
  }
}

```

But at this point, I'm missing the encrypted password that I could then pass through the decryption process.

## Enumeration with HQK Reporting 

After digging through all of the shared folders that C.Smith has access to, I remembered something peculiar about the initial nmap scan.

![nmap4386](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/nmap4386.png)

It looks like the service listening on port 4386 is able to take inputs and one of the available commands is DEBUG which seems to be a password, this instantly reminds me of the Debug Mode Password.txt file and the password contained within its ADS _WBQ201953D8w_ .
After a few failed attempts to talk to the service from my Kali VM, VbScrub (the machine's creator) hinted in an IM that Telnet would be the way to go since netcat doesn't work with that service.
```
telnet 10.10.10.178 4386
```

![telnet0](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/telnet0.png)

With the debug mode enabled, I'm able to use the service to navigate through directories as well as read contents of various files.

After some digging around through various directories and files, I find the encrypted Administrator password in the Ldap.conf file

![ldap](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/ldap.png)


## Privilege escalation to Administrator and getting the root flag


Time to go back to the HqkLdap.exe source code and make the necessary changes so that i can get it decrypted.

First, I had to do some changes to the code to fix some errors that, I'm assuming, are the result of the decompiling process.

>In ldap.cs I have commented the following lines since _enumerator_ wasn't defined anywhere
```
            finally
            {
             // if (enumerator is IDisposable)
               // (enumerator as IDisposable).Dispose();
            }
```
>In MyProject.cs I have added the two lines of code with the comments next to them in the following class
```
 internal sealed class ThreadSafeObjectProvider<T> where T : new()
    {
            [ThreadStatic, CompilerGenerated] //added to fix errors
            private static T m_ThreadStaticValue; // added to fix errors
      internal T GetInstance
      {
        [DebuggerHidden] get
        {
          if ((object) MyProject.ThreadSafeObjectProvider<T>.m_ThreadStaticValue == null)
            MyProject.ThreadSafeObjectProvider<T>.m_ThreadStaticValue = new T();
          return MyProject.ThreadSafeObjectProvider<T>.m_ThreadStaticValue;
        }
      }
```

Now, to actually decrypt the password, in MainModule.cs I've hijacked the following check
```
        else if (!File.Exists("HqkDbImport.exe"))
        {
          Console.WriteLine("Please ensure the optional database import module is installed");
        }
```
And used it to decrypt and output the password.

```
        else if (!File.Exists("HqkDbImport.exe"))
        {
                    // Since I don't have HqkDbImport.exe, I'll just use this check to throw the decrypted password instead of an error message :)
                    // Console.WriteLine("Please ensure the optional database import module is installed");
                    string MuhAdminPassword = CR.DS("yyEq[REDACTED]Vb4=");
                    Console.WriteLine("The Admin password is {0}", MuhAdminPassword);
                    Console.Read();
        }
```

I then save the solution, build it i copy the HQK_Config_Backup.xml file to the Debug directory where the new HqkLdap.exe was saved and run it from cmd. 

![AdminPass](/assets/images/HTB/Nest/AdminPass.png)

After getting the password, my initial attempt to get the root flag was to connect to \\\\10.10.10.178\\Users in hopes of finding the root.txt file in the Administrator directory, but the only thing I found there was a shortcut pointing to C$\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt, so I just connected to the C drive's administrative share instead.

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.178\\C$ -U Administrator
```
