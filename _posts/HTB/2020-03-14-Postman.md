# Hackthebox - Postman - 10.10.10.160

## Summary
Today [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) retired Postman, an easy-rated Linux box that hosts [redis](https://redis.io/topics/introduction) and [Webmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmin) services.
Here's my write-up.

>*Note that the screenshots are taken today (2020-03-14) because I didn't do a proper write-up during my first run on Postman.*

## Enumeration

For an initial scan I used the following nmap command 
```
nmap -sV -sT -sC -p- -o nmapinitial -T4 10.10.10.160
```
The initial nmap scan reveals the following opened ports: 22, 80, 6379 and 10000.

The services running on ports 6379 and 10000 caught my attention, so I decide to also run nmap's vulnscan script.

```
 nmap -T4 --script vuln -o vulnnmap 10.10.10.160
```

It turns out that the service running on port 10000 is vulnerable to [CVE-2006-3392](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3392).

While searching the internet for more details about the Redis service, I ran into [this article](https://medium.com/@Victor.Z.Zhu/redis-unauthorized-access-vulnerability-simulation-victor-zhu-ac7a71b2e419), which outlines a metdhod of using an insecure redis service to upload the attacker's ssh key. 

At this point, it looks like redis could be a viable way in, so i proceed with installing redis tools 
```
sudo apt-get install redis-tools
```
and generate a new ssh key.

![rsa_key](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/rsa_key.jpg)

## Foothold

I've copied the previously created key in a text file.
```
(echo -e "\n\n"; cat redis_key.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > temp.txt
``` 
I connect to redis and it looks like it's already in its ssh directory.

![redissshdirconfig](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/redissshdirconfig.jpg)

In another terminal tab I send the key to 10.10.10.160's redis server using 
```cat ./temp.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set s-key```

I then check that the key actually made it in redis

![rediskeyin](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/rediskeyin.jpg)

and proceed with saving the ssh key on the server.

![redissavekey](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/redissavekey.jpg)

Time to check if ssh as redis works with the newly added key.
![redisssh](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/redisssh.jpg)

## Enumerating server contents as redis

After looking through various directories, I find this ssh key backup in /opt belonging to the user Matt.

![MattKeyBackup](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/MattKeyBackup.jpg)

I copy it to my VM.

![CopyMattRsa](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/CopyMattRsa.jpg)

And i convert it to a john-readable file using ssh2john.py 
```python ~/Scripts/John/ssh2john.py Matt_rsa > Matt_hash```
so that i can crack it using john.

![MattPass](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/MattPass.jpg)

## User flag
The passowrd found by john is __computer2008__, but it looks like ssh is disabled for Matt.

![MattSSH](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/MattSSH.jpg)

So I try switching to Matt using the __computer2008__ password while logged in as redis via ssh.

![suMatt](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/suMatt.jpg)

Now I can get the user flag from Matt's home directory

![UserFlag](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/UserFlag.jpg)

## Privilege escalation and root flag

Going back to the vulnerability found during the initial enumeration phase, I try exploiting that using Matt's credentials in order to get root access.
Checking the Webmin login on https://10.10.10.160:10000 using Matt's credentials just to make sure it works.

![WebminDashboard](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/WebminDashboard.jpg)

Time to fire up msfconsole and check if there's a module already installed to exploit this.
![MsfconsoleSearch](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/MsfconsoleSearch.jpg)

I pick the required exploit 
```
use exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce
```
and configure its options to match the target.
![ExploitOptions](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/ExploitOptions.jpg)

I run it and wait for the connection
![GotRoot](/assets/images/HTB/Postman/GotRoot.jpg)

And that's it.
